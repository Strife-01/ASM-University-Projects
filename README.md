## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Arduino Buzzer Melody Player

- **Description**: 
  This project is written in Assembly and allows you to play melodies using an Arduino and a buzzer. The current melody programmed is the famous Nokia 3310 ringtone, but the system is designed to support any melody with modifications.
  
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Generating sound using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).
  - Timing control with precise delays in Assembly.
  - Programming microcontrollers with Assembly.
  
- **Hardware Requirements**:
  - Arduino board.
  - Buzzer.
  - Breadboard and jumper wires.
  
- **Usage**:
  1. Connect the buzzer to the Arduino as per the wiring diagram included in the project directory.
  2. Assemble the `.asm` file using the appropriate assembler for your microcontroller.
  3. Upload the generated binary file to the Arduino.
  4. Power on the Arduino and enjoy the melody!

### Project 2: Morse Code API

- **Description**: 
  This project provides a Morse Code API written in Assembly, allowing users to encode and transmit any Morse code proposition. It uses precise timing and LED or buzzer signaling to represent the dots and dashes of Morse code.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Morse code encoding logic.
  - Timing control for dot, dash, and pauses.
  - Efficient signal transmission using an LED or buzzer.
  
- **Usage**:
  1. Input your Morse code proposition in the format described in the project directory.
  2. Assemble the `.asm` file and execute it using the assembler or compatible hardware.
  3. The output is displayed or transmitted via LED or buzzer.

### Project 3: Efficient Bitwise Multiplication Algorithm

- **Description**: 
  This project implements an efficient algorithm for multiplication using bitwise shifting (left and right) operations. This method minimizes computational overhead and demonstrates how basic binary operations can perform complex arithmetic.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Bitwise operations (shifting left and right).
  - Binary arithmetic optimization.
  - Assembly-level algorithm implementation.

- **Usage**:
  1. Assemble the `.asm` file for the multiplication algorithm.
  2. Run the program and input two numbers to be multiplied.
  3. The output is displayed in binary and decimal format.
